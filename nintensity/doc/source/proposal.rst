Overview
----------------
Many companies like to promote healthy lifestyles. Some of them even provide allowances for their employees to participate in various fitness-related events. 

This project aims to create a Django-based site where employees of the same company can:

* Add events to a shared calendar 
* Form event-specific teams
* Log individual workouts into a personal workout history
* Share fitness statistics with friends
* Import data about their workouts from sources like Fitbit or RunKeeper
